an all-rabbit population tends to go to 100%, an all-fox population will go to 0
rabbits in isolation will probably grow, foxes in isolation will die out
these should be pretty straightforward to show with stochastic analysis techniques like we did in class.

most seeds that i've seen eventually stabilize seemed to cycle the rabbits nearly to zero before getting into a "stable loop". possibly because the foxes need to die out. perhaps this is due to the rabbit birth rate vs fox death rate; need to quantify this with probabilities.
show rabbits and foxes overlaid as a function of time. this is a different view of the same data that might suggest cyclic behavior/phases
compare/contrast with typical LV prey vs predator and pred vs time and prey vs time. also look at (pred/prey) as a function of time and see if that ratio can berelated to any probabilities
